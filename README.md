## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Patryk — a passionate web developer with hands-on experience in both freelance and team-based projects. I'm currently in my second year of Systems Engineering at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I focus on building clean, modern, and user-friendly web applications while continuously learning best practices and scalable architectures.

I build modern web applications with React and Next.js, focusing on performance and clean UI. I have experience working with APIs, deploying to VPS servers, and creating solutions tailored to real-world needs. I’ve also worked on custom WordPress themes.
